# kali-empire

A Kali Docker image with the dependencies Empire needs baked-in

This is based on the [Offensive Security Kali Docker Image](https://github.com/offensive-security/kali-linux-docker). We pre-install packages
required by [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire) to make feedback from continuous integration in CircleCI faster.
